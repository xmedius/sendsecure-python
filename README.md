**XMediusSENDSECURE (SendSecure)** is a collaborative file exchange platform that is both highly secure and simple to use.
It is expressly designed to allow for the secured exchange of sensitive documents via virtual SafeBoxes.

SendSecure comes with a **Web API**, which is **RESTful**, uses **HTTPs** and returns **JSON**.

Specific libraries have been published for various languages:
[C#](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-csharp),
[Java](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-java),
[JavaScript](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-js),
[PHP](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-php),
**Python**
and
[Ruby](https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-ruby).

# Installation

## Prerequisites

- Python version 2.7, 3.4 or 3.5
- The SendSecure service, provided by [XMedius](https://www.xmedius.com/en/products?source=sendsecure-python) (demo accounts available on demand)

## Install Package

```python
pip install https://github.com/xmedius/sendsecure-python/tarball/master
```

<a name="quickstart"></a>
# Quick Start

## Authentication (Retrieving API Token)

Authentication is done using an API Token, which must be first obtained based on SendSecure enterprise account and user credentials.
Here is the minimum code to get such a user-based API Token.

```python
from sendsecure import Client

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        enterprise_account = 'deathstar'
        username = 'darthvader'
        password = 'd@Rk$1De'

        device_id = 'DV-TIE/x1'
        device_name = 'TIE Advanced x1'
        application_type = 'The Force App'
        endpoint = 'https://portal.xmedius.com'

        token = Client.get_user_token(enterprise_account, username, password,
            device_id, device_name, application_type, endpoint)
        print 'User token:', token
    except Exception, details:
        print details
```

## SafeBox Creation (Using SafeBox Helper Class)

Here is the minimum required code to create a SafeBox â€“ with 1 recipient, a subject, a message and 1 attachment.
This example uses the user's *default* security profile (which requires to be set in the account).

```python
from sendsecure import Safebox, Recipient, ContactMethod, Attachment, Client

if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
         user_email = 'darthvader@empire.com'
         token = 'USER|1d495165-4953-4457-8b5b-4fcf801e621a'
         enterprise_account = 'deathstar'
         endpoint = 'https://portal.xmedius.com'

         safebox = Safebox(user_email)
         safebox.subject = 'Family matters'
         safebox.message = 'Son, you will find attached the evidence.'

         recipient = Recipient('lukeskywalker@rebels.com')
         recipient.contact_methods.append(ContactMethod('555-232-5334'))
         safebox.recipients.append(recipient);

         attachment = Attachment('Birth_Certificate.pdf', 'application/pdf');
         safebox.attachments.append(attachment);

         client = Client(token, enterprise_account, endpoint);
         safe_response = client.submit_safebox(safebox);
         print 'SafeBox ID:', safe_response.guid
    except Exception, details:
        print details
```
